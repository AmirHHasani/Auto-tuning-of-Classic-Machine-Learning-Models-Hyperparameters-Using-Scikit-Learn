# Auto-tuning-of-Classic-Machine-Learning-Models-Hyperparameters-Using-Scikit-Learn
To see the optimization process go to the end of the file.

I used Scikit-Learn to optimize some of the hyperparameters of Classic ML Models

At first I tried manual methods to do this. I also mentioned a few ways of evaluating a model.

I gathered a lot of info and put it into this file as a teaching material for class that I was teaching in.

I did not put all of my teaching material here but THIS IS THE HIGHLIGHT OF WHAT I TAUGHT, and as always I hope that it can help someone out.
